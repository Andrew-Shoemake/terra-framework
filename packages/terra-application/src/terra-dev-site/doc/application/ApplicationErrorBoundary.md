# Terra Application

## Application Error Boundary

The ApplicationErrorBoundary allows for the handling of render-time errors within the Terra Application framework.

> Note: ApplicationBase renders an ApplicationErrorBoundary by default, but additional ApplicationErrorBoundary components
can be used to scope errors within different areas of an application.
